### `sui_devInspectTransactionBlock`

Simulates running the transaction, even one that would be normally impossible, against the current state of the network. Nearly any transaction (or Move call) with any arguments can run in dev-inspect; transaction inputs are not checked, entry function verification is skipped, values can be left unused, and returns are not validated. Detailed results are provided, including both the transaction effects and any return values. Dev-inspect is provided to aid in understanding the effects of any possible action against the current network state. See dryRunTransactionBlock for a more faithful simulation of what would happen if the transaction were actually run.

#### Parameters

| Name | Required | Format | Description
|---|---|---|---|
| `sender_address` | True | `<SuiAddress>` | |
| `tx_bytes` | True | `<Base64>` | BCS encoded TransactionKind(as opposed to TransactionData, which include gasBudget and gasPrice) |
| `gas_price` | False | `<BigInt_for_uint64>` | Gas is not charged, but gas usage is still calculated. Default to use reference gas price |
| `epoch` | False | `<BigInt_for_uint64>` | The epoch to perform the call. Will be set from the system state object if not provided |

#### Result

##### `<DevInspectResults>`

| Name | Required | Format | Description
|---|---|---|---|
| `effects` | True | `<[TransactionBlockEffects]>` | Summary of effects that likely would be generated if the transaction is actually run. Note however, that not all dev-inspect transactions are actually usable as transactions so it might not be possible actually generate these effects from a normal transaction. |
| `error` | False | `<string,null>` | Execution error from executing the transactions |
| `events` | True | `<[Event]>` | Events that likely would be generated if the transaction is actually run. |
| `results` | False | `<[SuiExecutionResult]>` | Execution results (including return values) from executing the transactions |
