# Move.toml

Every Move package has a _package manifest_ in the form of a `Move.toml` file - it is placed in the [root of the package](https://docs.sui.io/build/move/index#move-code-organization). The manifest itself contains a number of sections, primary of which are:

- `[package]` - includes package metadata such as name and author
- `[dependencies]` - specifies dependencies of the project
- `[addresses]` - address aliases (eg `@me` will be treated as a `0x0` address)

```toml
[package]
name = "sui-by-example"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "main" }

[addresses]
examples = "0x0"
```
