Welcome to Sui Move by Example! Here we describe the [Sui Move](../learn/sui-overview/how-sui-move-differs.mdx) variant of the [Move](../learn/sui-overview/why-move.mdx) programming language and explain how to use it to [write smart contracts](../build/create-smart-contracts/smart-contracts.mdx) and [program with objects](../build/program-with-objects/object-basics.mdx).

These examples build upon the [smart contract examples](../build/quickstart/examples.mdx) already highlighted with component-by-component examples you may reference at any time. What is more expressive in the world of code than the code itself? In this book, you'll find examples for most of the features of Sui Move as well as a number of advanced patterns that can be used right away to improve your modules.

All code samples in this book are written with the assumption that you use _Sui Move_, which can installed with this command:

```
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch "main" sui
```
